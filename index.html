                            As a young kid in middle school, I was far from who
                            I felt I was meant to be. I struggled to articulate
                            my thoughts clearly. I would trip over my words,
                            speak jittery sentences, and constantly fear
                            embarrassment. I avoided the spotlight. Leadership
                            wasn’t something I chased — it was something I hid
                            from. I had no strong ambition, no visible
                            direction, just quiet uncertainty. As I grew older,
                            I naturally improved at basic social skills. I could
                            make friends, hold conversations, and navigate
                            situations better — but something still felt
                            incomplete. My confidence was surface-level.
                            Internally, I still doubted my ability to fully
                            express myself or take ownership of a bigger path.
                            Then I chose Computer Science — almost blindly. I
                            entered college without truly understanding what I
                            was stepping into. But freshman year marked a shift.
                            I made a conscious decision to become “new.” I began
                            stepping outside more, attending events, meeting
                            people, pushing myself socially in ways I never had
                            before. It wasn’t perfect — but it was progress.
                            Still, my future felt unpredictable. That
                            uncertainty began to change when I encountered
                            Professor Roger Kraft — an outstanding professor
                            whose depth of knowledge and intellectual intensity
                            left a strong impression on me. He carried a level
                            of ambition and understanding that sparked something
                            in me. For the first time, I saw what mastery looked
                            like. That inspiration triggered a chain reaction. I
                            began researching on my own. Reading outside of
                            class. Diving deeper into software concepts beyond
                            assignments. When I took my first true
                            software-focused course, I was amazed. It felt like
                            discovering a new world — one built on logic,
                            structure, and creativity. That moment lit a fire.
                            But that fire came with imbalance. In my eagerness
                            to pursue software engineering, I started viewing
                            other classes as distractions — obstacles between me
                            and what I wanted to focus on. I tried to allocate
                            all my time to SWE-related learning, missing a
                            crucial truth: the foundational courses I overlooked
                            were shaping my logical thinking. They were training
                            the mental muscles that allow me to understand not
                            just how systems work — but why. As I progressed, I
                            found myself immersed in research and self-driven
                            learning again — but this time with more maturity.
                            Around that same period, the idea for SchoolEm began
                            forming. At its core, SchoolEm addresses something
                            deeply personal to me. Growing up, I struggled with
                            articulation, confidence, and feeling aligned with
                            my potential. In college, I saw similar struggles
                            around me — students with talent but no platform to
                            express it, students with ambition but no structure
                            to channel it, students navigating isolation in
                            environments meant to foster growth. SchoolEm became
                            my response to that problem. It is my attempt to
                            build a system that helps students connect,
                            collaborate, express their abilities, and grow into
                            who they are meant to become — without waiting years
                            to discover their direction like I did. I’m still
                            evolving. My future isn’t fully mapped out. But I’m
                            no longer uncertain about one thing: I am building
                            myself the same way I build software — iteratively,
                            intentionally, and with long-term vision.
